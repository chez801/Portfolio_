My online resume

## Bio:
My name is Chezney Hendricks and I am a registered Industrial Psycologist.
I completed my six month bootcamp with Hyperion Dev and it was my first programming/
data science experience. I found it very challenging, however my love for data and learning
helped me get through the course. I am now looking at way to implement my learning in my department 
since I deal with Human Capital data.

I am highly motivated to make a difference through working with data, moving from transactional to predictive 
and then, ultimately, prescriptive data. I would like to have the opportunity to make a difference in any business,
while continuing to learn in this vast, and exponentially growing field. I would ultimately like to move into a data science
role however I believe there are so many components of data I can still learn.

which was sparked by my passion for understanding and working with data. I've had exposure to SQL and Power BI and 
would like to explore dashboarding further while I upskill in data science and programming.

## Projects

Through Hyperion Dev I have been able to work on projects pertaining to:
### Python for Data Science
This focused mostly on intoduction to programming
 
### Data Analytics and Exploration
I found this highly enjoyable as it focused on the aspects of my current role in the Python IDE.
